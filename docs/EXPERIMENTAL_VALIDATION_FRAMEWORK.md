## 2. Experimental Design Framework

### 2.1 Controlled Laboratory Experiments

#### Experiment 1: Address Uniqueness Validation
**Setup:**
- Generate $N = \{10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6\}$ HALE addresses
- Compare with UUID, IPv6, and custom hash-based addressing
- Measure collision rates and distribution properties

**Protocol:**
```python
def uniqueness_experiment(N, precision_bits):
    addresses = set()
    collisions = 0
    
    for i in range(N):
        signature = generate_random_signature()
        address = hale_address(signature, precision_bits)
        
        if address in addresses:
            collisions += 1
        else:
            addresses.add(address)
    
    return collisions / N, len(addresses)
```

**Expected Results:**
- Collision rate < $2^{-p+\log_2(N)}$ as predicted by theory
- Better distribution than hash-based methods
- Graceful degradation with reduced precision

#### Experiment 2: Computational Performance Benchmarking
**Setup:**
- Measure address generation time for varying signature sizes
- Compare memory usage across different implementations
- Test on multiple hardware platforms (x86, ARM, embedded)

**Metrics:**
- Time complexity: $T(k) = O(k \log k)$ validation
- Space complexity: $S(k) = O(k)$ validation
- Constant factors and practical performance

#### Experiment 3: Semantic Consistency Validation
**Setup:**
- Create test datasets across multiple domains (IoT, AI, networking)
- Measure semantic similarity using established metrics
- Correlate with harmonic resonance calculations

**Protocol:**
```python
def semantic_consistency_test(domain1, domain2):
    entities1 = sample_entities(domain1)
    entities2 = sample_entities(domain2)
    
    for e1 in entities1:
        for e2 in entities2:
            semantic_sim = measure_semantic_similarity(e1, e2)
            harmonic_res = calculate_resonance(e1.signature, e2.signature)
            
            correlations.append((semantic_sim, harmonic_res))
    
    return pearson_correlation(correlations)
```

## 3. Statistical Validation Methodology

### 3.1 Hypothesis Testing Framework

#### Power Analysis
For each experiment, determine required sample sizes for statistical significance:

$$n = \frac{(z_{\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 \sigma^2}{(\mu_1 - \mu_0)^2}$$

Where:
- $\alpha = 0.05$ (significance level)
- $\beta = 0.20$ (power = 80%)
- $\sigma$ = estimated standard deviation
- $\mu_1 - \mu_0$ = expected effect size

#### Multiple Comparison Correction
Apply Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing:

$$\alpha_{\text{corrected}} = \frac{\alpha}{m}$$

Where $m$ is the number of simultaneous tests.

### 3.2 Confidence Intervals and Effect Sizes

Report results with:
- 95% confidence intervals for all measurements
- Cohen's d for effect size quantification
- Practical significance thresholds

### 3.3 Reproducibility Requirements
